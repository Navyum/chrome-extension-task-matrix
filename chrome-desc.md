📋 QUADRANT BREAKDOWN (Eisenhower Matrix Core)

The 4 quadrants that make task prioritization simple:
🚨 Q1 (Important & Urgent) – Crisis management, time-sensitive deadlines, immediate action items.
🎯 Q2 (Important & Not Urgent) – Strategic planning, skill development, relationship building, long-term goals.
⏳ Q3 (Not Important & Urgent) – Routine interruptions, non-essential emails, tasks others can handle.
🚫 Q4 (Not Important & Not Urgent) – Distractions, mindless scrolling, low-value time wasters.
